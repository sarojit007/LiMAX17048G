# MAX17048G+T10 Fuel Gauge Sensor
Analog Devices MAX17048G+T10 Lithium Ion 1S Fuel Gauge Library


This is an Arduino library for interfacing the Analog Devices MAXIM-MAX17048G+T10 Lithium Ion 1S Fuel Gauge. These ICs communicate with an I2C bus at speeds up to 400kHz, and the MAX17048G library uses the Wire library and simple Wire functions to operate, but due to some problems, I am creating this library.


MAX17048G+T10 is the latest chip manufactured by Analog Devices and is very low-cost compered to other chips in the same category. Working of this chip is little bit different from the MAX17043/44 older chip.
